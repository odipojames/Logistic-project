### Linting

[![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)

A pre-commit linting hook has been configured to run `black` on all files changed. To ensure you have black and pre-commit
up and running, please do the following.

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

`pre-commit install`

Once you have run these commands, you're good to go.
